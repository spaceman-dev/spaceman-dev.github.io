title: Data Science analysis of Coronavirus cases in New York City Neighborhood

1. Introduction 

1.1 Background:
We all know the chaos that the present COVID-19 virus has unleashed upon humans. What we don’t know yet is when exactly will a proper vaccine ever be implemented. Till then what we do know is the fact that a simple quarantine can help keep the virus at bay.

2. Data Acquisition and Cleaning

2.1 Data Acquisition:
The Data Acquired for this project is a combination of a few sources, the most used of them being from the nychealth’s github account- https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/data-by-modzcta.csv
2.2 Data Description:
--From nychealth-github
Case reporting
NYC COVID-19 data include people who live in NYC or who live in another country but are being treated in NYC. The data do not include people who live outside of NYC but in the United States.
Rates vs. Cases
The Health Department is reporting rates of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in addition to counts. We report rates to give clear comparisons between different groups — such as borough, sex, or age — with differently sized populations. For example, we may report that the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases is 100 per 100,000 population in NYC. That means for every 100,000 people living in NYC, there are 100 people diagnosed with COVID-19.
Changes to Reported Data
We update data for earlier dates after we resolve testing and reporting delays. Reported data reflect what we know at the time of the report, not what occurred in real time. For example, we may find that a person who was originally reported to live in NYC no longer does. This person would be removed from our dataset after their address is updated, and our case count would decrease by one.
data-by-modzcta.csv
This file contains data by modified ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTA). This unit of geography is similar to ZIP codes but combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size for rate calculation. Please see description of modified ZCTAs in the technical notes section (Geography: Zip codes and ZCTAs).
This file contains the following cumulative indicators by modified ZCTA:
•	Count of confirmed cases
•	Rate of confirmed cases per 100,000 people by ZCTA
•	Population denominators for ZCTAs derived from intercensal estimates by the Bureau of Epidemiology Services (see “Rates per 100,000 people” for more details)
•	Count of confirmed deaths
•	Rate of confirmed deaths per 100,000 people by ZCTA
•	Percentage of people ever tested for COVID-19 who tested positive
This file includes the corresponding neighborhood and borough for each modified ZCTA.
•	Modified ZCTA
•	Neighborhood name
•	Borough name
Neighborhood names represent the 42 NYC United Hospital Fund (UHF) neighborhood. All cases are assigned to a UHF neighborhood based on ZCTA. Borough names are assigned according to the UHF neighborhood.
Note that sum of counts in this file may not match values in Citywide tables because of records with missing geographic information. This file does not currently contain information on probable deaths.
2.3 Data Cleaning:
Since the data acquired is in its raw form, it is required to clean it. 


 


We require the data per neighborhood, and that is done with the help of pandas’s group by option.
 


Finally whats left is to link each neighborhood to its respective location(coordinates)
